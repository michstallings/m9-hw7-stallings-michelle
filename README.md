Recources used:

-The week 8 in class code for reference
- https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_transition_hover.asp

Issues faced:
- Not necessarily a issue, but I wasn't 100% sure how to have the locations list appear below the button after click. 
I referenced the in class code for this but I did not see anything to cause that exact location, which is why I settled with a side reveal. 

- Also not an issue necessarily, but I know the hovers could be done with event listeners in the Javascript which was probable the intention, but to me
it seems simplier to just use :hover in the css. Does it really matter which is used or is it more so a personal preference?
